A woman painter sits holding a paint palette in front of a large paint-by-numbers portrait of herself in a similar pose. In the vertical portrait, the woman in the foreground and the painting in the background make up three quarters of the entire picture. From the bottom left corner, there is the top of a chair that she is sitting on while she looks directly at the viewer. In the top left corner, behind the woman, there is a dark background. The woman’s body is centered in the painting. She is shown from mid-body, with her right arm holding a long paintbrush, which is pulling paint from a palette held in her left hand. In the background, starting at the midpoint to the right edge, is a paint-by-numbers portrait of her. Much of the portrait she is working on has not been filled in, except for some of the background and her jacket, which is similar to the one she is wearing while she is painting
